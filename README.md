## Quick Start

### Production Mode
Clone the repository  
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <project-folder>
Configure environment variables as needed 
export DEPLOY_ENV=production
Run deployment script
./scripts/deploy.sh
Monitor system health using monitoring scripts or dashboards

### Development Mode

Install dependencies
npm install

Run tests
npm test

Start development server
npm run dev

Access dashboard
open http://localhost:3000

### Experimental/AI Mode
Install AI dependencies
pip install tensorflow keras

Initialize AI models
./scripts/init-ai-models.sh

Start with AI-enhanced mode
npm run start:ai

Access AI dashboard
open http://localhost:9000

## AI Integration
Our experimental system uses machine learning to:
- Predict optimal deployment times
- Auto-scale based on predicted load
- Detect anomalies before they cause issues
- Suggest configuration improvements

## Documentation
See the `/docs` folder for detailed documentation on system architecture, API reference, and troubleshooting.

Additional experimental documentation: `/docs/ai-integration.md`
